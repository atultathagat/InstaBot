# InstaBot
In this project, I have scrap different data of various instagram handles related to food and restaurants such as number of followers, number of likes, number of posts made in previous 3 days and most popular hashtags used in different posts with the help of Selenium and BeautifulSoup. With the help of Matplotlib library, I have visualized the scraped data through suitable graphs. Also, I have achieved various self automated tasks using Selenium such as login through instagram, searching and opening a profile, following and unfollowing an user, liking and unliking different posts, checking stories and extracting top 500 followers of a particular handle.
